Experimental neuroscience is increasingly reliant on the ability to deliver precise amounts of liquid substances to animal subjects. This practice underlies the ability to shape animal behaviour through successive, automated, reinforcement, allowing training in more demanding behavioural tasks. 
Here we introduce a stepper-motor-based, fully integrated, open-source solution, that allows the reproducible delivery of small (<1$\mu L$) liquid volumes.
The system can be controlled via software using the Harp protocol (e.g. via Bonsai or Python), or directly via TTL I/O capabilities. While the designed circuit board is compatible with a variety of motor models and mechanical designs, we provide schematics and step-by-step instructions for the one used in this manuscript.
Next, we characterize the behavior of the full system using a computer-vision method capable of measuring across-trial delivery of small volumes, an important benchmark when keeping behaviour experiments in mind. Finally, we provide experimental validation of our system by using it in a psychophysics rodent experiment and during electrophysiological recordings.
