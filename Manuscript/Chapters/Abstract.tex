Experimental behavioural neuroscience relies on the ability to deliver precise amounts of liquid volumes to animal subjects, in order to progressively shape behaviour through successive, automated, reinforcement, thus allowing training in more demanding behavioural tasks and the manipulation of variables that underlie the decision making process (\textit{e.g.:} reward magnitude).
Here we introduce a stepper-motor-based, fully integrated, open-source solution, that allows the reproducible delivery of small (<1$\mu L$) liquid volumes.
The system can be controlled via software using the Harp protocol (\textit{e.g.:} from Bonsai or Python), or directly through a low-level I/O interface. Moreover, while both software and electronics are compatible with a wide variety of motor models and mechanical designs, we also provide schematics, and step-by-step instructions, for the mechanical design used, and described, in this manuscript.
We characterized the behaviour of the full system using a computer-vision method capable of measuring across-trial delivery of small volumes, an important benchmark when having behaviour experiments in mind. Finally, we provide experimental validation of our system by employing it during a psychophysics rodent task, and during electrophysiological recordings.
