Inspired by previous projects (\citep{Amarante2019, Wijnen2014}), we present a fully integrated, and characterized, system for micro-litter range fluid delivery targeted towards neuroscience behavior experiments. 
 
We designed a simple protocol which allowed us provide an extensive characterization of trial-to-trial variability in the fluid delivery dynamics. An import stack of tests when considering the intended use of this system for rodent behavior experiments.

We provide an alternative to gravity-based passive systems, by designing a scalable and affordable solution that allows for dynamic control over reward delivery, without suffering from the long-term stability issues often associated with the former systems. Additionally, we also highlight the afforded control gained over flow-rate that such an non-passive system allows.
Importantly, we also tested the compatibility of the system with common neuroscience experimental demands by deploying it during rodent behavior and electrophysiological recording experiments.

Finally, we provide users with several options to interface with the system, affording flexible configuration and easy integration into already-existing experimental rigs.
