	abstract = {The direct and indirect pathways of the basal ganglia are
	classically thought to promote and suppress action,
	respectively1. However, the observed co-activation of striatal
	direct and indirect medium spiny neurons2 (dMSNs and iMSNs,
	respectively) has challenged this view. Here we study these
	circuits in mice performing an interval categorization task that
	requires a series of self-initiated and cued actions and,
	critically, a sustained period of dynamic action suppression.
	Although movement produced the co-activation of iMSNs and dMSNs
	in the sensorimotor, dorsolateral striatum (DLS), fibre
	photometry and photo-identified electrophysiological recordings
	revealed signatures of functional opponency between the two
	pathways during action suppression. Notably, optogenetic
	inhibition showed that DLS circuits were largely engaged to
	suppress-and not promote-action. Specifically, iMSNs on a given
	hemisphere were dynamically engaged to suppress tempting
	contralateral action. To understand how such regionally specific
	circuit function arose, we constructed a computational
	reinforcement learning model that reproduced key features of
	behaviour, neural activity and optogenetic inhibition. The model
	predicted that parallel striatal circuits outside the DLS learned
	the action-promoting functions, generating the temptation to act.
	Consistent with this, optogenetic inhibition experiments revealed
	that dMSNs in the associative, dorsomedial striatum, in contrast
	to those in the DLS, promote contralateral actions. These data
	highlight how opponent interactions between multiple circuit- and
	region-specific basal ganglia processes can lead to behavioural
	control, and establish a critical role for the sensorimotor
	indirect pathway in the proactive suppression of tempting
	actions.},
