	abstract = {<p>Reinforcement learning theory plays a key role in understanding the behavioral and neural mechanisms of choice behavior in animals and humans. Especially, intermediate variables of learning models estimated from behavioral data, such as the expectation of reward for each candidate choice (action value), have been used in searches for the neural correlates of computational elements in learning and decision making. The aims of the present study are as follows: (1) to test which computational model best captures the choice learning process in animals and (2) to elucidate how action values are represented in different parts of the corticobasal ganglia circuit. We compared different behavioral learning algorithms to predict the choice sequences generated by rats during a free-choice task and analyzed associated neural activity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and ventral pallidum (VP). The major findings of this study were as follows: (1) modified versions of an action–value learning model captured a variety of choice strategies of rats, including win-stay–lose-switch and persevering behavior, and predicted rats' choice sequences better than the best multistep Markov model; and (2) information about action values and future actions was coded in both the NAc and VP, but was less dominant than information about trial types, selected actions, and reward outcome. The results of our model-based analysis suggest that the primary role of the NAc and VP is to monitor information important for updating choice behaviors. Information represented in the NAc and VP might contribute to a choice mechanism that is situated elsewhere.</p>},

@article{Guo2014,
	abstract = {The mouse is an increasingly prominent model for the analysis of mammalian neuronal circuits. Neural circuits ultimately have to be probed during behaviors that engage the circuits. Linking circuit dynamics to behavior requires precise control of sensory stimuli and measurement of body movements. Head-fixation has been used for behavioral research, particularly in non-human primates, to facilitate precise stimulus control, behavioral monitoring and neural recording. However, choice-based, perceptual decision tasks by head-fixed mice have only recently been introduced. Training mice relies on motivating mice using water restriction. Here we describe procedures for head-fixation, water restriction and behavioral training for head-fixed mice, with a focus on active, whisker-based tactile behaviors. In these experiments mice had restricted access to water (typically 1 ml/day). After ten days of water restriction, body weight stabilized at approximately 80% of initial weight. At that point mice were trained to discriminate sensory stimuli using operant conditioning. Head-fixed mice reported stimuli by licking in go/no-go tasks and also using a forced choice paradigm using a dual lickport. In some cases mice learned to discriminate sensory stimuli in a few trials within the first behavioral session. Delay epochs lasting a second or more were used to separate sensation (e.g. tactile exploration) and action (i.e. licking). Mice performed a variety of perceptual decision tasks with high performance for hundreds of trials per behavioral session. Up to four months of continuous water restriction showed no adverse health effects. Behavioral performance correlated with the degree of water restriction, supporting the importance of controlling access to water. These behavioral paradigms can be combined with cellular resolution imaging, random access photostimulation, and whole cell recordings.},

	abstract = {<p>Syringe pumps are a necessary piece of laboratory equipment that are used for fluid delivery in behavioral neuroscience laboratories. Many experiments provide rodents and primates with fluid rewards such as juice, water, or liquid sucrose. Current commercialized syringe pumps are not customizable and do not have the ability to deliver multiple volumes of fluid based on different inputs to the pump. Additionally, many syringe pumps are expensive and cannot be used in experiments with paired neurophysiological recordings due to electrical noise. We developed an open source syringe pump controller using commonly available parts. The controller adjusts the acceleration and speed of the motor to deliver three different volumes of fluid reward within one common time epoch. This syringe pump controller is cost effective and has been successfully implemented in rodent behavioral experiments with paired neurophysiological recordings in the rat frontal cortex while rats lick for different volumes of liquid sucrose rewards. Our syringe pump controller will enable new experiments to address the potential confound of temporal information in studies of reward signaling by fluid magnitude.</p>},

@article{Cruz2022,
	abstract = {The direct and indirect pathways of the basal ganglia are
	classically thought to promote and suppress action,
	respectively1. However, the observed co-activation of striatal
	direct and indirect medium spiny neurons2 (dMSNs and iMSNs,
	respectively) has challenged this view. Here we study these
	circuits in mice performing an interval categorization task that
	requires a series of self-initiated and cued actions and,
	critically, a sustained period of dynamic action suppression.
	Although movement produced the co-activation of iMSNs and dMSNs
	in the sensorimotor, dorsolateral striatum (DLS), fibre
	photometry and photo-identified electrophysiological recordings
	revealed signatures of functional opponency between the two
	pathways during action suppression. Notably, optogenetic
	inhibition showed that DLS circuits were largely engaged to
	suppress-and not promote-action. Specifically, iMSNs on a given
	hemisphere were dynamically engaged to suppress tempting
	contralateral action. To understand how such regionally specific
	circuit function arose, we constructed a computational
	reinforcement learning model that reproduced key features of
	behaviour, neural activity and optogenetic inhibition. The model
	predicted that parallel striatal circuits outside the DLS learned
	the action-promoting functions, generating the temptation to act.
	Consistent with this, optogenetic inhibition experiments revealed
	that dMSNs in the associative, dorsomedial striatum, in contrast
	to those in the DLS, promote contralateral actions. These data
	highlight how opponent interactions between multiple circuit- and
	region-specific basal ganglia processes can lead to behavioural
	control, and establish a critical role for the sensorimotor
	indirect pathway in the proactive suppression of tempting
	actions.},
